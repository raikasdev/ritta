# Ritta/Application
Ritta is a system for schools to keep connection between home and school strong.

## Installation

Ritta is currently in a very early stage, and installing is not recommended.
If you still want to test how's the prototypes going, download the sources and extract them.

Run following command in the folder to install `npm install`\
And start with `npm test`

## Credits

Ritta's web interface is currently based on [Stisla](https://getstisla.com) template, to make the development easier as [I](https://github.com/raikasdev) am not a great front-end developer. Their credits can be found [here](https://demo.getstisla.com/credits.html) if you want to watch.
