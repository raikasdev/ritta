## Our goals

We want to create a modern solution for nowday's standards. About 50% of **all** traffic is from mobile devices, and when talking about students, more and more do not have a access to a desktop computer. So, making a fast, secure, responsive and a modern solution for schools to strengthen the connection between home and school.
Later, a mobile app (probably will be made with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)) will be also coded after the API and core features are done.
