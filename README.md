## Our goals

We want to create a modern solution for nowday's standards. About 50% of **all** traffic is from mobile devices, and when talking about students, more and more do not have a access to a desktop computer. So, making a fast, secure, responsive and a modern solution for schools to strengthen the connection between home and school.

## Project structure

Ritta is currently spread across multiple repos:

- [ritta-server (the API-server)](https://github.com/rittaschool/ritta-server)
- [ritta-next (NextJS web frontend)](https://github.com/rittaschool/ritta-server)

## What/how?

We use TypeScript for programming, NodeJS for the runtime, NestJS (with mongoose/MongoDB) as the web server framework.
We also do testing using Jest, as it has some level of support for ES6 TypeScript.
We highly recommend to using nginx or other something else on top of Ritta as a reverse proxy.
